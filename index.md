I'm Karthik, an experienced quant professional currently transitioning into a quant research/trading role at Squarepoint Capital, a large quant hedge fund. My background spans all the main quant roles (trading, research, dev) at various types of firms (prop trading, market making, hedge fund), providing me with a unique perspective across different facets of the quant world. My experience includes:

*   **Quantitative Researcher** at **Squarepoint Capital** (Quant Hedge Fund). (2025-Present).
*   **Quantitative Trader** at **Maven Securities** (Options Market Making Firm). (2022-2025)
*   **Software Engineer** at **Five Rings Capital** (Prop Trading firm). (2021-2022).
*   BA Math + CS from the **University of Cambridge** (First Class Honours, ranked top 10).

Across these roles, I've **reviewed a large number of resumes and cover letters** and **conducted many interviews** for quant positions. This experience has given me a clear understanding of what quant firms are seeking, allowing me to offer practical advice. I've also **successfully negotiated** my own and others' compensation packages, so I understand how to maximise your offer.

My experience in various types of firms and roles has shown me what's really important in the quant recruitment process. I know how tough it can be, and I'm passionate about helping people like you succeed. I've guided many individuals to great quant positions at top-tier companies, and I'm confident I can help you too.
